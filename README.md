## 🧠 JavaScript Concepts Covered

This project demonstrates and reinforces the following JavaScript concepts:

- **Forms & Validation**  
  Validates user input for task name and time.

- **Callbacks**  
  Used for error handling and flow control in task validation.

- **Closures**  
  Encapsulates task properties like name, remaining time, and completion status within `createTask`.

- **Hoisting**  
  Variables like `tasks` are hoisted and used across multiple functions.

- **Asynchronous JavaScript**  
  - `setTimeout` — to trigger reminders.
  - `setInterval` — to update the countdown timer in real time.
